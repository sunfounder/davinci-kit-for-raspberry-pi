1.4 Hare
==============

Today, we will use Button, Raspberry Pi and Scratch to create a hare with various changes!

When we press the first button, the hare in the stage area will change its body color; when we press the second button, the hare will change its body size; when we press the third button, the hare will take a step forward.

Load the Code and See What Happens
-----------------------------------------

Load the code file (``1.4_hare.sb3``) into Scratch 3.

Now you can try to press each of the 3 buttons to see how the Hare on the stage will change.


Tips on Sprite
----------------

Click the **Choose a Sprite** button in the lower right corner of the sprite area, enter **Hare** in the search box, and then click to add it.

Tips on Codes
--------------

This is an event block that is triggered when the level of GPIO17 is high, which means that the button is pressed at that moment.

This is a block to change the color of **Hare**, the range of the value is 0 ~ 199, beyond 199 will change from 0 again.

This is a block used to change the size for sprite, the higher the value, the larger the sprite.

.. note::
  The sprite is also not infinitely large, and its maximum size is related to the original image size.

This is a block that switches sprite costumes, and when **Hare**'s costume keeps switching, it does a series of coherent actions. For example, in this project, make **Hare** take a step forward.
