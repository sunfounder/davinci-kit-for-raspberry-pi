Video 10: Making a Dimmable LED with Two Push Buttons
=======================================================================================

This tutorial covers the construction of dimmable LED circuits using Raspberry Pi GPIO pins, 
focusing on achieving smooth brightness control. Paul McQuarter demonstrates the process step-by-step, 
from circuit setup to coding implementation. In the Raspberry Pi section, he explains how to build the circuit using GPIO pins and push buttons for control, 
alongside Python coding for PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) control. 
The video explores the nuances of PWM, 
emphasizing non-linear changes in duty cycle for smoother brightness transitions and addressing synchronization issues between PWM frequency and camera scanning rate. 
The video introduces the concept of using exponential scale for achieving smooth and precise brightness control. 
It delves into mathematical concepts like logarithms and exponents, illustrating their application in coding for LED brightness control. 
Troubleshooting tips are provided for debugging and refining the code to ensure optimal performance.
