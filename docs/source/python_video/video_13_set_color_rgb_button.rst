Video 13: Set Color of RGB LED with Push Buttons
=======================================================================================

This video demonstrates how to control an RGB LED using buttons with a Raspberry Pi, covering hardware setup, coding, and troubleshooting.

1. Learn how to connect RGB LEDs and buttons to a Raspberry Pi GPIO.
2. Understand the importance of systematic code organization for easier debugging.
3. Set up GPIO pins for both input (buttons) and output (LED control).
4. Implement a main loop to continuously read button states and update LED states.
5. Follow debugging and testing procedures to ensure proper functionality.
6. Explore color mixing by adjusting red, green, and blue values to create a spectrum of colors.
