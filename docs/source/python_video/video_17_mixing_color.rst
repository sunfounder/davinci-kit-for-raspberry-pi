Video 17: Mixing Any Color on an RGB LED
=======================================================================================

The video discusses the process of building and mastering RGB LED control with Raspberry Pi and an ADC0834 chip. It begins with an introduction to the tutorial series, sponsored by SunFounder, focusing on Raspberry Pi projects. The previous episode's task involved creating a dimmable LED, and now the focus shifts to replacing it with an RGB LED.

The circuit overview includes the utilization of an ADC0834 chip, potentiometers, and resistors for the RGB LED setup. Wiring instructions emphasize the importance of using straight jumper wires for a clean build and GPIO pin assignments. Moving on to coding RGB LED control, Python and Thonny IDE are used to modify the LED control program for PWM control of each color channel.
