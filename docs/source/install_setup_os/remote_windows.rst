For Windows Users
=======================

For Windows 10 or higher users, remote login to a Raspberry Pi can be achieved through the following steps:

#. Search for ``powershell`` in your Windows search box. Right-click on ``Windows PowerShell`` and select ``Run as administrator``.

        :align: center

#. Determine your Raspberry Pi's IP address by typing ``ping -4 <hostname>.local`` in PowerShell.

    .. code-block::

        ping -4 raspberrypi.local

    The Raspberry Pi's IP address will be displayed once it's connected to the network.

    * If the terminal displays ``Ping request could not find host pi.local. Please check the name and try again.``, verify the hostname you've entered is correct.
    * If the IP address still isn't retrievable, check your network or WiFi settings on the Raspberry Pi.

#. Once the IP address is confirmed, log in to your Raspberry Pi using ``ssh <username>@<hostname>.local`` or ``ssh <username>@<IP address>``.

    .. code-block::

        ssh pi@raspberrypi.local

    .. warning::

        If an error appears stating ``The term 'ssh' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet...``, your system may not have SSH tools pre-installed. In this case, you need to manually install OpenSSH following :ref:`openssh_powershell`, or use a third-party tool as described in :ref:`login_windows`.

#. A security message will appear on your first login. Enter ``yes`` to proceed.

    .. code-block::

        The authenticity of host 'raspberrypi.local (2400:2410:2101:5800:635b:f0b6:2662:8cba)' can't be established.
        ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:oo7x3ZSgAo032wD1tE8eW0fFM/kmewIvRwkBys6XRwg.
        Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?

#. Enter the password you previously set. Note that the password characters won't be displayed on the screen, which is a standard security feature.

    .. note::
        The absence of visible characters when typing the password is normal. Ensure you input the correct password.

#. Once connected, your Raspberry Pi is ready for remote operations.
