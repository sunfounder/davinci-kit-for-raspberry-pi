Video 48: Adding Boxes, Rectangles and Circles on Images in OpenCV
=======================================================================================


In this Raspberry Pi tutorial, learn how to annotate video frames using OpenCV, adding rectangles, circles, and text overlays to enhance your projects.


1. **Introduction**: Overview of the SunFounder Raphael kit for Raspberry Pi.
2. **Recap of previous lesson**: Using OpenCV to display video frames and overlay text.
3. **Annotating video frames**: Adding rectangles, circles, and text annotations between grabbing and displaying frames.
4. **Key considerations**: Understanding image coordinates (column, row) and color representation (RGB).
5. **Homework assignment**: Practice annotating video frames with different shapes and colors to reinforce learning.
6. **Performance impact**: Annotating frames may slightly reduce frame rate, so optimize annotations for efficiency.
