Video 31: Alarm for Detecting Motion in the Dark
=======================================================================================


This video demonstrates how to build an intruder alarm system using a Raspberry Pi, motion sensor, light sensor, and buzzer, providing step-by-step guidance on both the hardware setup and Python coding.


1. **Introduction to the project**: Building an intruder alarm system using Raspberry Pi.
2. **Overview of the components used**: Raspberry Pi, PIR motion sensor, light sensor (ADC-0834), active buzzer, and transistor (S8550).
3. **Explanation of the hardware setup**: Wiring the components together, including connecting the buzzer, motion sensor, and light sensor to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.
4. **Coding the alarm system**: Using Python code to read sensor inputs, detect motion and darkness, and trigger the buzzer alarm accordingly.
5. **Testing the system**: Demonstrating the functionality of the alarm system by simulating intruder detection in different lighting conditions.
6. **Discussion of future projects**: Previewing upcoming tutorials on additional components like accelerometers, gyroscopes, RFID, and cameras for further Raspberry Pi projects.
