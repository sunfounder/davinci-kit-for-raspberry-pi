Projects
=============

In this section, you will start learning to create IoT projects.

Before starting the project, you should have downloaded the code we provided (:ref:`Download the Code`).

Then copy the codes from the ``iot`` folder to the ``cloud4rpi-raspberrypi-python`` folder.

.. code-block:: shell

    cp -r /home/pi/davinci-kit-for-raspberry-pi/iot/* /home/pi/cloud4rpi-raspberrypi-python


.. toctree::
