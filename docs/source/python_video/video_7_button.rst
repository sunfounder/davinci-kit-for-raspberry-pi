Video 7: GPIO Inputs from Button Switch
=======================================================================================

Learn how to simplify GPIO circuits for switches or push buttons by using the internal pull-up resistor in Raspberry Pi GPIO pins, including a demonstration of the concept, circuit setup, and Python code example to toggle an LED.

1. Understanding pull-up and pull-down resistors in GPIO circuits.
2. Demonstrating a circuit setup with a push button, pull-up resistor, and LED.
3. Introducing the concept of using the internal pull-up resistor in Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.
4. Explaining how to activate the internal pull-up resistor in the GPIO pin setup.
5. Providing a Python code example to toggle an LED using a push button, utilizing the internal pull-up resistor.
6. Highlighting the importance of toggle switches in practical applications and assigning a homework task to implement a toggle switch using the existing circuit.
