Video 59: Control System for Pan/Tilt Camera Hat for RPi Camera
=======================================================================================


In this tutorial, sponsored by SunFounder, 
viewers learn how to implement a pan-tilt tracking system using a Raspberry Pi and camera. 
The video builds upon previous lessons, focusing on dual-mode operation for training and tracking. 
It starts with an overview of the previous homework assignment involving pan and tilt tracking. 
The dual-mode system is explained, comprising training mode for calibration and tracking mode for active tracking. 
Code implementation for controlling servos based on user input is demonstrated, along with tilt error calculation to adjust the camera angle. 
Safeguards are implemented to prevent the camera from tilting too far, ensuring safe operation.

1. Introduction to SunFounder-sponsored tutorial series.
2. Overview of the previous homework assignment on pan and tilt tracking.
3. Introduction to the dual-mode system: training mode for calibration and tracking mode for active tracking.
4. Demonstration of code implementation for servo control based on user input.
5. Explanation of tilt error calculation and its role in adjusting the camera angle.
6. Implementation of safeguards to prevent excessive tilting for safe operation.
7. Adjusting tilt angle dynamically based on predefined conditions.
8. Testing the tracker in various modes and troubleshooting errors.
9. Engaging in a homework assignment to enhance the control system intelligently.
10. Introduction to future topics, including expanding object tracking capabilities beyond color-based tracking.
