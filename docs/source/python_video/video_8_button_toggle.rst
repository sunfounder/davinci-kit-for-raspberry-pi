Video 8: Using a Button as a Toggle Switch for LED Control
=======================================================================================

Learn how to create a toggle LED circuit using a Raspberry Pi and Python programming.

1. **Circuit Setup**: Setting up an LED and a push-button switch connected to GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi.
2. **Python Programming**: Using the RPi.GPIO library to control the GPIO pins and read the state of the push-button switch.
3. **Toggle Logic**: Implementing logic in Python to toggle the LED based on the state of the push-button switch.
4. **Variable Management**: Using variables to track the current and previous states of the push-button switch and the LED.
