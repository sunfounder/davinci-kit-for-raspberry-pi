Video 16: Creating a Potentiometer Controlled Dimmable LED
=======================================================================================


This video demonstrates how to create a dimmable LED using a Raspberry Pi, ADC-0834 analog-to-digital converter, and pulse-width modulation (PWM) techniques, offering a comprehensive guide from hardware setup to coding in Python.

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the tutorial series sponsored by SunFounder.
2. **Homework Assignment**: Recap of the previous lesson's task to create a dimmable LED controlled by a potentiometer.
3. **Hardware Setup**: Explanation of the components required, including Raspberry Pi, ADC-0834, potentiometer, and LED with a current-limiting resistor.
4. **GPIO Pin Setup**: Setting up GPIO pins and initializing PWM for LED control.
5. **Python Coding**: Step-by-step guide to coding in Python using Thonny, covering library import, pin setup, and duty cycle calculation.
6. **Mathematical Calculation**: Explanation of the math involved in mapping potentiometer readings to LED brightness levels.
7. **Demonstration**: Live demonstration of the dimmable LED functionality.
8. **Next Homework Assignment**: Announcement of the upcoming task to use an RGB LED and multiple potentiometers for color mixing.
