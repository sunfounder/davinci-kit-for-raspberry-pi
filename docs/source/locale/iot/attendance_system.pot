#: ../iot/attendance_system.rst:48
msgid "Once added, you can view the clock-in records for different time periods on the Chart widget (when the value of LED ON is True, it means someone clocked in), and then view the number of people who clocked in on the Text widget."

msgid "If the person's name is written to the MFRC522 RFID Module in advance, and then the id is replaced with text in the code (which will be mentioned later in the code explanation), so that the attendance sheet records the name of each person, rather than the ID of the card."

#: ../iot/attendance_system.rst:116
msgid "First, we set ``attendance`` to False, which means that no one is clocked in."

msgid "First determine if the id is duplicated in ``attendance_list`` by an if statement, if not, it means the punch-in is valid and pass the id information into ``attendance_list``. Then we get the current timestamp and use the id as the key of the ``attendance_statistics`` dictionary and ``present_time`` as the value of the corresponding key. In this way, the ``attendance_statistics`` dictionary stores the punch time of the current id."

#: ../iot/attendance_system.rst:137
msgid "Finally we write the ``attendance_statistics`` dictionary to a .csv file and name the file as ``'attendance_sheet.'' + present_date + '.csv'``, so that we store the attendance sheet in time order."
