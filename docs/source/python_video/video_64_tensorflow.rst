Video 64: Object Detection on Raspberry Pi Using Tensorflow Lite
=======================================================================================



This video compares two different approaches for setting up object detection on a Raspberry Pi: 
one using TensorFlow Lite and the other using OpenCV with TensorFlow. In the first tutorial, 
viewers learn to set up TensorFlow Lite for object detection on a Raspberry Pi, covering installation, 
camera configuration, and object detector setup. The second tutorial focuses on setting up object detection using OpenCV and TensorFlow, 
exploring various parameters, image conversion, tensor image creation, object detection, visualization, and camera exploration.


1. Introduction to object detection on Raspberry Pi using TensorFlow Lite and OpenCV with TensorFlow.
2. Setting up the environment: Installing necessary dependencies and libraries for each approach.
3. Configuring cameras: Setting up Raspberry Pi camera and webcam for image capture.
4. Object detection setup: Configuring parameters and thresholds for detecting objects in images.
5. Image conversion and tensor creation: Converting images to compatible formats and creating tensor images for TensorFlow processing.
6. Running object detection: Utilizing TensorFlow models for detecting objects in images.
7. Visualizing results: Displaying detection results on original images with bounding boxes and labels.
8. Camera exploration: Assessing the performance of object detection with different cameras and adjusting parameters accordingly.
