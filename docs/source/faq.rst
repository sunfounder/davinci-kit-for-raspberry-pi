============
C code is not working?
----------------------------------


* Check your wiring for problems.
* Check if the code is reporting errors, if so, refer to: :ref:`install_wiringpi`.
* Has the code been compiled before running.
* If all the above 3 conditions are OK, it may be that your wiringPi version (2.50) is not compatible with your Raspberry Pi 4B and above, refer to :ref:`install_wiringpi` to manually upgrade it to version 2.52.
