Temperature and Humidity Acquisition
======================================

In this project, we use DHT11 to read the surrounding temperature and humidity, and then display them on Cloud4RPi.

Experimental Procedures
-------------------------

Build the circuit.

.. image:: img/tem4.png
  :align: center

Open the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block:: 

    cd ~/cloud4rpi-raspberrypi-python
    sudo nano temperature_and_humidity_acquisition.py

Find the line below and fill in the correct device token.

.. code-block:: python

    DEVICE_TOKEN = '__YOUR_DEVICE_TOKEN__'

Run the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block:: 

    sudo python3 temperature_and_humidity_acquisition.py

Go to Cloud4RPi, add a new Control Panel named project1, and click **Add Widget**.

Select a **Chart** widget with both **Room Temp** and **CPU Temp** as the variables to be displayed.

Once added, you will see the temperature (Room Temp) and humidity (CPU Temp) curves over time, and you can adjust the display window by clicking on the options at the bottom right.

Code Explanation
----------------------

.. code-block:: python

    dht11 = DHT11.DHT11(17)

Instantiate a dht11 object.

.. code-block:: python

    def getTem():
        result = dht11.get_result()
        while True:
            if result:
                break
            else:
                result = dht11.get_result()
        return result[1]

The temperature (``result[1]``) is obtained by this function, and the function will not be interrupted until the reading is successful.

.. code-block:: python

    def getHum():
    result = dht11.get_result()
    while True:
        if result:
            break
        else:
            result = dht11.get_result()
    return result[0]

The humidity (``result[0]``) is obtained by this function, and the function will not be interrupted until the reading is successful.

.. code-block:: python

    variables = {
        'Room Temp': {
            'type': 'numeric',
            'bind': getTem
        },
        'CPU Temp': {
            'type': 'numeric',
            'bind': getHum
        },
    }

The temperature is stored in the ``'bind'`` of the ``'Room Temp'`` key, and the humidity is stored in the ``'bind'`` of the ``'CPU Temp'`` key. When Cloud4RPi receives the ``variables`` dictionary, it will convert it into a JavaScript object that can be recognized by the web page.
