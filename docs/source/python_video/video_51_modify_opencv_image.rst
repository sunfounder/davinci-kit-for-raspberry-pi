Video 51: Modifying OpenCV Images and Creating Regions of Interest
=======================================================================================

In this tutorial, we delve into advanced image manipulation techniques with the Raspberry Pi camera, 
covering topics such as extracting and manipulating regions of interest (ROI), understanding pixel data, and working with frame dimensions.

1. **Understanding frame dimensions and pixel data**: Learn about the structure of frames as rows and columns of pixels, each containing three color values (blue, green, red).
2. **Manipulating individual pixels**: Explore how to access and modify individual pixels within a frame using row and column indices.
3. **Handling edge cases**: Be mindful of edge cases when accessing pixels, such as starting indexing at zero and adjusting for the last row and column.
4. **Working with ranges in frames**: Learn efficient manipulation techniques by working with ranges of pixels within a frame.
5. **Defining regions of interest (ROI)**: Understand how to define and extract specific regions of interest from a frame for further processing.
6. **Applying ROI to image manipulation**: Utilize extracted ROIs to manipulate specific areas of an image, including copying and moving regions within the frame.
