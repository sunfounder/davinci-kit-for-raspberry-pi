Blinking Dot
===========================

In this project, we will draw a dot on Processing, which blinks synchronously with the LED. Please build the circuit as shown in the diagram and run the sketch.

**Sketch**

.. code-block:: arduino

    import processing.io.*;
    int ledPin = 17; 
    boolean state = true; 

    void setup() {
        size(100, 100);
        frameRate(2); //set frame rate
        GPIO.pinMode(ledPin, GPIO.OUTPUT); //set the ledPin to output mode 
    }

    void draw() {
        state = !state;
        if (state==true) {
            GPIO.digitalWrite(ledPin, GPIO.LOW); //led on 
            fill(255, 0, 0); //set the fill color of led on
        } else {
            GPIO.digitalWrite(ledPin, GPIO.HIGH); //led off
            fill(155); //set the fill color of led off
        } 
        ellipse(width/2, height/2, width*0.75, height*0.75);
    }

**How it works?**

At the beginning of the sketch, you need to embed Processing's GPIO function library by ``import processing.io.*;``, which is indispensable for circuit experiments.

**Frame rate** is the frequency of bitmaps appearing on the board, expressed in hertz (Hz). In other words, it is also the frequency at which the ``draw()`` function is called. In ``setup()``, setting the **frame rate** to 2 will call ``draw()`` every 0.5s.

Each call of the ``draw()`` function takes the inverse of ``state`` and subsequently determines it. If the value is ``true``, the LED is lit and the brush is filled with red; if not, the LED is turned off and the brush is filled with gray.

After completing the judgment, use the ``ellipse()`` function to draw a circle. It should be noted that ``width`` and ``height`` are system variables used to store the width and height of the display window.

There are two other points to note. When using GPIOs, you need to use the ``GPIO.pinMode()`` function to set the INPUT/OUTPUT state of the pin, and then use the ``GPIO.digitalWrite()`` function to assign a value (HIGH/LOW) to the pin .


.. note::

    Please try to avoid using ``delay()`` in ``draw()`` because it will affect the display window refresh.
