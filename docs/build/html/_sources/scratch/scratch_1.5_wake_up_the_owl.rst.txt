1.5 Wake up the Owl
====================

Today we are going to play a game of waking up the owl.

When someone approaches the PIR sensor module, the owl will wake up from sleep.

Load the Code and See What Happens
---------------------------------------

Load the code file (``1.5_wake_up_the_owl.sb3``) to Scratch 3.

When you approach the PIR sensor module, you will see the owl on the stage area open its wings and wake up, and when you leave, the owl will go back to sleep again.


Tips on Sprite
----------------

Select Sprite1 and click **Costumes** in the top left corner; upload **owl1.png** and **owl2.png** from the ``home/pi/davinci-kit-for-raspberry-pi/scratch/picture`` path via the **Upload Costume** button; delete the default 2 costumes, and rename the sprite to **owl**.

When the green flag is clicked, the initial state of gpio17 is set to low.

When pin17 is low (no one is approaching), switch the costume of the owl sprite to owl1 (sleeping state).

When pin17 is high (someone is approaching), we switch the costume of owl sprite to owl2 (wake up state).
