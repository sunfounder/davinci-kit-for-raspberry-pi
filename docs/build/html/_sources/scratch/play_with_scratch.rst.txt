Play with Scratch
====================

Scratch is a block-based visual programming language and website targeted primarily at children 8-16 as an educational tool for coding. Users of the site can create projects on the web using a block-like interface. The service is developed by the MIT Media Lab, has been translated into 70+ languages, and is used in most parts of the world.


Here you will learn to use Scratch 3 in Raspberry Pi and access Raspberry Pi GPIO with Scratch 3, which is not possible with online Scratch.
