3.1.7 Traffic Light
=====================

Introduction
---------------

In this project, we will use LED lights of three colors to realize the
change of traffic lights and a four-digit 7-segment display will be used
to display the timing of each traffic state.

Experimental Procedures
------------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

.. image:: img/image254.png
   :width: 800


**Step 2:** Change directory.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block:: 

    cd ~/davinci-kit-for-raspberry-pi/c/3.1.7/

**Step 3:** Compile.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block:: 

    gcc 3.1.7_TrafficLight.c -lwiringPi

**Step 4:** Run.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block:: 

    sudo ./a.out

As the code runs, LEDs will simulate the color changing of traffic
lights. Firstly, the red LED lights up for 60s, then the green LED
lights up for 30s; next, the yellow LED lights up for 5s. After that,
the red LED lights up for 60s once again. In this way, this series of
actions will be executed repeatedly.

.. note::

    If it does not work after running, or there is an error prompt: \"wiringPi.h: No such file or directory\", please refer to :ref:`C code is not working?`.


**Code Explanation**

.. code-block:: c

    #define     SDI     5 
    #define     RCLK    4  
    #define     SRCLK    1   

    const int placePin[] = {12, 3, 2, 0};
    unsigned char number[] = {0xc0, 0xf9, 0xa4, 0xb0, 0x99, 0x92, 0x82, 0xf8, 0x80, 0x90};

    void pickDigit(int digit);
    void hc595_shift(int8_t data);
    void clearDisplay();
    void display();

These codes are used to realize the function of number display of 4-Digit 7-Segment 
Displays. Refer to :ref:`1.1.5 4-Digit 7-Segment Display` of the document for more details. Here, we use the 
codes to display countdown of traffic light time.

.. code-block:: c

    const int ledPin[]={6,10,11};  

    int colorState = 0;

    void lightup()
    {
        for(int i=0;i<3;i++){
            digitalWrite(ledPin[i],HIGH);
        }
        digitalWrite(ledPin[colorState],LOW);    
    }

The codes are used to switch the LED on and off.

.. code-block:: c

    int greenLight = 30;
    int yellowLight = 5;
    int redLight = 60;
    int colorState = 0;
    char *lightColor[]={"Red","Green","Yellow"};
    int counter = 60;

    void timer(int  timer1){       //Timer function
        if(timer1 == SIGALRM){   
            counter --;         
            alarm(1); 
            if(counter == 0){
                if(colorState == 0) counter = greenLight;
                if(colorState == 1) counter = yellowLight;
                if(colorState == 2) counter = redLight;
                colorState = (colorState+1)%3; 
            }
            printf("counter : %d \t light color: %s \n",counter,lightColor[colorState]);
        }
    }

The codes are used to switch the timer on and off. Refer to :ref:`1.1.5 4-Digit 7-Segment Display` for more details. Here, when the timer returns to zero, colorState
will be switched so as to switch LED, and the timer will be assigned to
a new value.

.. code-block:: c

    void loop()
    {
        while(1){
        display();
        lightup(); 
        }
    }

    int main(void)
    {
        //â€¦
        signal(SIGALRM,timer);  
        alarm(1); 
        loop();
        return 0;
    }

The timer is started in the main() function. In loop() function, use
**while(1)** loop and call the functions of 4-Digit 7-Segment and LED.
