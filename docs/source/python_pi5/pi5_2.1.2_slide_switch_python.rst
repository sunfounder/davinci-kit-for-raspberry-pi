2.1.2 Slide Switch
==================

Introduction
------------

In this project, we will learn how to use a slide switch. Usually,the
slide switch is soldered on PCB as a power switch, but here we need to
insert it into the breadboard, thus it may not be tightened. And we use
it on the breadboard to show its function.

Required Components
------------------------------

In this project, we need the following components.

.. raw:: html

   <br/>

Schematic Diagram
-----------------

Connect the middle pin of the Slide Switch to GPIO17, and two LEDs to
pin GPIO22 and GPIO27 respectively. Then when you pull the slide, you
can see the two LEDs light up alternately.

Experimental Procedures
-----------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

.. image:: ../python_pi5/img/2.1.2_slide_switch_circuit.png

**Step 2**: Get into the folder of the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/davinci-kit-for-raspberry-pi/python-pi5

**Step 3**: Run.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    sudo python3 2.1.2_Slider_zero.py

While the code is running, get the switch connected to the left, then
the yellow LED lights up; to the right, the red light turns on.

**Code**

.. note::

    You can **Modify/Reset/Copy/Run/Stop** the code below. But before that, you need to go to  source code path like ``davinci-kit-for-raspberry-pi/python-pi5``. After modifying the code, you can run it directly to see the effect.


.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   from gpiozero import LED, Button  # Import LED and Button classes for GPIO control
   from time import sleep  # Import sleep function for adding delays

   # Initialize the micro switch on GPIO pin 17 with the pull-up resistor disabled
   micro_switch = Button(17, pull_up=False)
   # Initialize LED1 on GPIO pin 22
   led1 = LED(22)
   # Initialize LED2 on GPIO pin 27
   led2 = LED(27)

   try:
       # Main loop to control LED states based on the micro switch's state
       while True:
           if micro_switch.is_pressed:  # Check if the micro switch is pressed
               print('    LED1 ON    ')  # Print status message
               led1.on()   # Turn on LED1
               led2.off()  # Turn off LED2
           else:  # If the micro switch is not pressed
               print('    LED2 ON    ')  # Print status message
               led1.off()  # Turn off LED1
               led2.on()   # Turn on LED2

           sleep(0.5)  # Wait for 0.5 seconds before rechecking the switch state

   except KeyboardInterrupt:
       # Handle a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C) for a clean exit from the loop
       pass
 

**Code Explanation**

#. This line sets the script to run with Python 3. It imports ``LED`` and ``Button`` from ``gpiozero`` for controlling GPIO devices, and ``sleep`` from ``time`` for delays.

   .. code-block:: python

       #!/usr/bin/env python3
       from gpiozero import LED, Button  # Import LED and Button classes for GPIO control
       from time import sleep  # Import sleep function for adding delays

#. Initializes a micro switch connected to GPIO pin 17 with the pull-up resistor disabled, and two LEDs connected to GPIO pins 22 and 27.

   .. code-block:: python

       # Initialize the micro switch on GPIO pin 17 with the pull-up resistor disabled
       micro_switch = Button(17, pull_up=False)
       # Initialize LED1 on GPIO pin 22
       led1 = LED(22)
       # Initialize LED2 on GPIO pin 27
       led2 = LED(27)

#. The main loop checks the state of the micro switch. If pressed, LED1 turns on and LED2 off; if not pressed, LED1 off and LED2 on. The loop repeats every 0.5 seconds. Catches a KeyboardInterrupt (like Ctrl+C) to allow for graceful script termination.

   .. code-block:: python

       try:
       # Main loop to control LED states based on the micro switch's state
       while True:
           if micro_switch.is_pressed:  # Check if the micro switch is pressed
               print('    LED1 ON    ')  # Print status message
               led1.on()   # Turn on LED1
               led2.off()  # Turn off LED2
           else:  # If the micro switch is not pressed
               print('    LED2 ON    ')  # Print status message
               led1.off()  # Turn off LED1
               led2.on()   # Turn on LED2

           sleep(0.5)  # Wait for 0.5 seconds before rechecking the switch state

       except KeyboardInterrupt:
           # Handle a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C) for a clean exit from the loop
           pass
