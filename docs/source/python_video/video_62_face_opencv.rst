Video 62: Finding and Tracking Faces In OpenCV with Haar Cascades
=======================================================================================


Learn how to create a camera application on your Raspberry Pi using OpenCV, 
covering face and eye detection, performance optimization, and real-time face tracking.


1. Setting up your Raspberry Pi environment with the SunFounder Raspberry Pi kit.
2. Writing code for capturing video frames and implementing face and eye detection using OpenCV.
3. Optimizing performance by limiting the region of interest (ROI) for eye detection.
4. Understanding the concept of ROI and its impact on processing speed.
5. Real-time face tracking using OpenCV and a pan-tilt servo.
