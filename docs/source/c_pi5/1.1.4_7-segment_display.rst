1.1.4 7-segment Display
=============================

Introduction
-----------------

Let's try to drive a 7-segment display to show a figure from 0 to 9 and
A to F.

Components
----------------

.. image:: img/list_7_segment.png

Principle
-------------

**7-Segment Display**

A 7-segment display is an 8-shaped component which packages 7 LEDs. Each
LED is called a segment - when energized, one segment forms part of a
numeral to be displayed.

There are two types of pin connection: Common Cathode (CC) and Common
Anode (CA). As the name suggests, a CC display has all the cathodes of
the 7 LEDs connected when a CA display has all the anodes of the 7
segments connected. In this kit, we use the former.

Each of the LEDs in the display is given a positional segment with one
of its connection pins led out from the rectangular plastic package.
These LED pins are labeled from "a" through to "g" representing each
individual LED. The other LED pins are connected together forming a
common pin. So by forward biasing the appropriate pins of the LED
segments in a particular order, some segments will brighten and others
stay dim, thus showing the corresponding character on the display.

**Display Codes**

To help you get to know how 7-segment displays(Common Cathode) display
Numbers, we have drawn the following table. Numbers are the number 0-F
displayed on the 7-segment display; (DP) GFEDCBA refers to the
corresponding LED set to 0 or 1, For example, 00111111 means that DP and
G are set to 0, while others are set to 1. Therefore, the number 0 is
displayed on the 7-segment display, while HEX Code corresponds to
hexadecimal number.

**74HC595**

The 74HC595 consists of an 8âˆ’bit shift register and a storage register
with threeâˆ’state parallel outputs. It converts serial input into
parallel output so you can save IO ports of an MCU.

When MR (pin10) is high level and OE (pin13) is low level, data is input
in the rising edge of SHcp and goes to the memory register through the
rising edge of SHcp. If the two clocks are connected together, the shift
register is always one pulse earlier than the memory register. There is
a serial shift input pin (Ds), a serial output pin (Q) and an
asynchronous reset button (low level) in the memory register. The memory
register outputs a Bus with a parallel 8-bit and in three states. When
OE is enabled (low level), the data in memory register is output to the
bus.

**Pins of 74HC595 and their functions**:

* **Q0-Q7**: 8-bit parallel data output pins, able to control 8 LEDs or 8 pins of 7-segment display directly.

* **Q7â€™**: Series output pin, connected to DS of another 74HC595 to connect multiple 74HC595s in series.

* **MR**: Reset pin, active at low level;

* **SHcp**: Time sequence input of shift register. On the rising edge, the data in shift register moves successively one bit, i.e. data in Q1 moves to Q2, and so forth. While on the falling edge, the data in shift register remain unchanged.

* **STcp**: Time sequence input of storage register. On the rising edge, data in the shift register moves into memory register.

* **CE**: Output enable pin, active at low level.

* **DS**: Serial data input pin

* **VCC**: Positive supply voltage

* **GND**: Ground

Schematic Diagram
---------------------

Connect pin ST_CP of 74HC595 to Raspberry Pi GPIO18, SH_CP to GPIO27, DS
to GPIO17, parallel output ports to 8 segments of the LED segment
display. Input data in DS pin to shift register when SH_CP (the clock
input of the shift register) is at the rising edge, and to the memory
register when ST_CP (the clock input of the memory) is at the rising
edge. Then you can control the states of SH_CP and ST_CP via the
Raspberry Pi GPIOs to transform serial data input into parallel data
output so as to save Raspberry Pi GPIOs and drive the display.

Experimental Procedures
------------------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

For C Language Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Step 2: Get into the folder of the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/davinci-kit-for-raspberry-pi/c/1.1.4/

Step 3: Compile.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    gcc 1.1.4_7-Segment.c -lwiringPi

Step 4: Run the executable file above.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    sudo ./a.out

After the code runs, you'll see the 7-segment display display 0-9, A-F.

.. note::

    If it does not work after running, or there is an error prompt: \"wiringPi.h: No such file or directory\", please refer to :ref:`C code is not working?`.

**Code**

.. code-block:: c

    #include <wiringPi.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #define   SDI   0   //serial data input
    #define   RCLK  1   //memory clock input(STCP)
    #define   SRCLK 2   //shift register clock input(SHCP)
    unsigned char SegCode[16] = {0x3f,0x06,0x5b,0x4f,0x66,0x6d,0x7d,0x07,0x7f,0x6f,0x77,0x7c,0x39,0x5e,0x79,0x71};

    void init(void){
        pinMode(SDI, OUTPUT); 
        pinMode(RCLK, OUTPUT);
        pinMode(SRCLK, OUTPUT); 
        digitalWrite(SDI, 0);
        digitalWrite(RCLK, 0);
        digitalWrite(SRCLK, 0);
    }

    void hc595_shift(unsigned char dat){
        int i;
        for(i=0;i<8;i++){
            digitalWrite(SDI, 0x80 & (dat << i));
            digitalWrite(SRCLK, 1);
            delay(1);
            digitalWrite(SRCLK, 0);
        }
            digitalWrite(RCLK, 1);
            delay(1);
            digitalWrite(RCLK, 0);
    }

    int main(void){
        int i;
        if(wiringPiSetup() == -1){ //when initialize wiring failed, print messageto screen
            printf("setup wiringPi failed !");
            return 1;
        }
        init();
        while(1){
            for(i=0;i<16;i++){
                printf("Print %1X on Segment\n", i); // %X means hex output
                hc595_shift(SegCode[i]);
                delay(500);
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }

**Code Explanation**

unsigned char SegCode[16] = {0x3f,0x06,0x5b,0x4f,0x66,0x6d,0x7d,0x07,0x7f,0x6f,0x77,0x7c,0x39,0x5e,0x79,0x71};
A segment code array from 0 to F in Hexadecimal (Common cathode).

.. code-block:: c

    void init(void){
        pinMode(SDI, OUTPUT); 
        pinMode(RCLK, OUTPUT); 
        pinMode(SRCLK, OUTPUT); 
        digitalWrite(SDI, 0);
        digitalWrite(RCLK, 0);
        digitalWrite(SRCLK, 0);
    }

Set ds, st_cp, sh_cp three pins to OUTPUT, and the initial state as 0.
void hc595_shift(unsigned char dat){}
To assign 8 bit value to 74HC595â€™s shift register.

.. code-block:: c

    digitalWrite(SDI, 0x80 & (dat << i));

Assign the dat data to SDI(DS) by bits. Here we assume dat=0x3f(0011 1111, when i=2, 0x3f will shift left(<<) 2 bits. 1111 1100 (0x3f << 2) & 1000 0000 (0x80) = 1000 0000, is true.

.. code-block:: c

    digitalWrite(SRCLK, 1);

SRCLK's initial value was set to 0, and here it's set to 1, which is to generate a rising edge pulse, then shift the DS date to shift register.

.. code-block:: c
        
		digitalWrite(RCLK, 1);

RCLK's initial value was set to 0, and here it's set to 1, which is to generate a rising edge, then shift data from shift register to storage register.

.. code-block:: c

    while(1){
            for(i=0;i<16;i++){
                printf("Print %1X on Segment\n", i); // %X means hex output
                hc595_shift(SegCode[i]);
                delay(500);
            }
        }

In this for loop, we use \"%1X\" to output i as a hexadecimal number. Apply i to find the corresponding segment code in the SegCode[] array, and employ hc595_shift() to pass the SegCode into 74HC595's shift register.
