Video 60: Improved Pan/Tilt Tracking Control Algorithm
=======================================================================================



In this tutorial, we delve into optimizing a Raspberry Pi camera control system, 
focusing on enhancing its speed and stability through algorithm adjustments.


1. Introduction: The video introduces the optimization of a Raspberry Pi camera control system to improve its speed and stability.
2. System Shortcomings: The previous control system was slow and made corrections one degree at a time, leading to inefficiency.
3. Proposed Solution: The speaker proposes adjusting the control algorithm to take "smart steps" proportional to the error, ensuring faster and more accurate movements.
4. Algorithm Derivation: Mathematical derivation of the new control algorithm for both pan and tilt movements is explained.
5. Code Implementation: The implementation of the new control algorithm is demonstrated, including adjustments to limit servo movements and ensure stability.
6. Testing and Conclusion: The video concludes with testing of the optimized control system, highlighting parameter adjustments for optimal performance.
