Video 20: Controlling Position of a Servo With a Potentiometer
=======================================================================================

This video demonstrates how to control servo position using a potentiometer and Raspberry Pi GPIO, including explanations of circuit setup, Python coding, ADC, PWM, mathematical calculations, error handling, and the importance of connections.


#. **Circuit Setup**: Review of the previous lesson's analog input circuit using the ADC0834 for Raspberry Pi.
#. **Servo Setup**: Instructions for setting up the servo in the circuit, including wiring and power considerations.
#. **Understanding ADC and PWM**: Get familiar with the concepts of Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).
#. **Reading analog signals**: Discover how to read analog signals from a potentiometer connected to the Raspberry Pi.
#. **Calculating PWM percentage**: Learn the formula to calculate the PWM percentage based on the analog signal value obtained.
#. **Controlling a servo motor**: Explore the process of applying the calculated PWM percentage to control the position of a servo motor.
#. **Synchronization**: Ensure synchronization between the potentiometer's position and the servo motor's position for accurate control.
#. **Mathematical Calculations**: Explanation of the mathematical calculations used to determine PWM values based on potentiometer readings.
#. **Error Handling**: Implementation of try-except blocks for program termination and GPIO cleanup.
#. **Importance of connections**: Understand the significance of establishing reliable connections for precise readings and outputs.
