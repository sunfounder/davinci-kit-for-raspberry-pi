Video 42: How to Send Data to the PC over WiFi or Ethernet Using UDP
=======================================================================================


The video demonstrates how to set up client-server communication between a Raspberry Pi and a PC using Python and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). 
It covers the creation of both server and client programs, initialization and binding of sockets, data exchange, and basic functionality implementation.

1. **Introduction to Client-Server Communication**: Understanding the need for cleaner remote connections.
2. **Server Program Creation**: Step-by-step guide to creating a server program on Raspberry Pi using Python's socket library.
3. **Socket Initialization and Binding**: Learning how to initialize and bind sockets for communication.
4. **Data Exchange**: Exploring the process of sending and receiving data between the PC and Raspberry Pi.
5. **Client Program Creation**: Discovering how to create a client program on the PC side to communicate with the Raspberry Pi server.
6. **Server Address Setup**: Specifying the server address (Raspberry Pi's IP) in the client code.
7. **UDP Client Creation**: Utilizing the socket library to create a UDP client on the client side.
8. **Communication Initiation**: Initiating communication by sending requests from the client to the server.
9. **Request Handling on Server**: Processing client requests and sending back responses on the server.
10. **Data Decoding**: Decoding received data using UTF-8 encoding for readability.
11. **Basic Functionality Implementation**: Demonstrating bidirectional communication with a simple example of counter manipulation.
