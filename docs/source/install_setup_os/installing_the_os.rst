#. Define a **hostname** for your Raspberry Pi.

    .. note::

        The hostname is your Raspberry Pi's network identifier. You can access your Pi using ``<hostname>.local`` or ``<hostname>.lan``.

#. Create a **Username** and **Password** for the Raspberry Pi's administrator account.

    .. note::

        Establishing a unique username and password is vital for securing your Raspberry Pi, which lacks a default password.

#. Configure the wireless LAN by providing your network's **SSID** and **Password**.

    .. note::

        Set the ``Wireless LAN country`` to the two-letter `ISO/IEC alpha2 code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements>`_ corresponding to your location.
