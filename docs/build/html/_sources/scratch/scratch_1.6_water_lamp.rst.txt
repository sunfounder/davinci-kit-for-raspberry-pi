1.6 Water Lamp
================


Today, we will use LED Bar Graph, Raspberry Pi and scratch to make a Water Lamp.

The LED Bar Graph will light up in order with the direction of the arrows on the stage.

Load the Code and See What Happens
-----------------------------------------

Load the code file (``1.6_water_lamp.sb3``) from your computer to Scratch 3.

By clicking on **Arrow1**, the LEDs on the LED bar are lit in sequence from the left to the right (one at a time) and then off. Click **Arrow2** and the LEDs light up in the opposite order.

Tips on Sprites
----------------

Delete the default sprite and choose the **Arrow1** sprite.

Here we will need 2 **Arrow1** sprites, which can be done with the duplicate button.

Click on the **Arrow 2** sprite and change the direction of the arrow by selecting costume 2.

Now let's make a variable.

Name it as **num**.

Follow the same method to create a list called **led**.

After adding, you should see the **num** variable and the **led** list on the stage area. 

Click **+** to add 10 list items and enter the pin numbers in order (17,18,27,22,23,24,25,2,3,8).

Tips on Codes

This is an event block that is triggered when the current sprite is clicked.

The initial value of the **num** variable determines which LED is lit first.

Set the pin corresponding to **num** in the led list to low to light the LED, and then set the pin corresponding to **num-1** to high to turn off the previous LED.
