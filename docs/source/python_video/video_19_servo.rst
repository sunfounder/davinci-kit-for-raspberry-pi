Video 19: Simple Control of Servo From Raspberry Pi
=======================================================================================


Learn how to control a servo motor with a Raspberry Pi as Paul McQuarter guides you through the setup, coding, and testing process.

1. **Hardware setup**: Paul demonstrates the correct wiring and alignment of the servo motor with the Raspberry Pi.
2. **Power considerations**: He explains the importance of using an external power supply for larger servos to avoid damaging the Raspberry Pi.
3. **PWM basics**: Understand how Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) controls the servo motor's position by adjusting the duty cycle of the PWM signal.
4. **Python code implementation**: Walk through the Python code to set up and control the servo motor using GPIO pins.
5. **Testing and calibration**: Learn how to test and calibrate the servo motor's range of motion by inputting different PWM percentages.
6. **Error handling**: Discover how to handle errors and ensure proper cleanup of GPIO pins using try-except blocks in Python.
