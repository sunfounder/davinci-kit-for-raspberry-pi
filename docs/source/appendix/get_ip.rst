Get the IP address
=========================

There are many ways to know the IP address, and two of them are listed as follows.

**Checking via the router**

If you have permission to log in the router(such as a home network), you can check the addresses assigned to Raspberry Pi on the admin interface of router.

The default hostname of the Raspberry Pi OS is raspberrypi, and you need to find it. (If you are using ArchLinuxARM system, please find alarmpi.)

**Network Segment Scanning**

You can also use network scanning to look up the IP address of Raspberry Pi. You can apply the software, **Advanced IP scanner** and so on.

Scan the IP range set, and the name of all connected devices will be displayed. Similarly, the default hostname of the Raspberry Pi OS is raspberrypi, if you havenâ€™t modified it.
