Video 43: How to Build a Simple Client Server System with Raspberry Pi
=======================================================================================

Learn how to establish a client-server communication system with Raspberry Pi, where the Raspberry Pi serves as the server, 
making temperature and humidity measurements upon receiving commands from a PC client.


#. **Setting up the Raspberry Pi server**: Configuring GPIO pins, creating a UDP server socket.
#. **Handling client requests**: Continuously listening for commands, decoding and parsing data.
#. **Sensor readings**: Obtaining temperature and humidity readings from the DHT11 sensor.
#. **Data exchange**: Sending sensor data back to the client for display.
#. **Client-side implementation**: Establishing the client socket, sending commands, receiving and processing data.
