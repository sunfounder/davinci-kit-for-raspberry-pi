Video 34: Creating a Python Class and Library for Reading a Keypad
=======================================================================================


This tutorial covers the process of creating a Python class to read input from a keypad connected to a Raspberry Pi. 
It begins with an introduction to the Raspberry Pi tutorial series sponsored by SunFounder. 
The hardware setup is explained, detailing the connections of the keypad using GPIO pins. 
The video then walks through the step-by-step process of creating a "keypad" class to manage keypad functionality, 
including initialization methods and GPIO pin configuration within the class. 
The method for reading input from the keypad by scanning rows and columns is implemented. 
Additionally, the video discusses code logic, button press detection to prevent repeated inputs, 
concatenation of input characters, configuration of return characters, 
and the creation of a reusable Python library encapsulating keypad functionality. 
Potential applications beyond keypad input, such as integration with LCD displays and cameras, are also explored.
