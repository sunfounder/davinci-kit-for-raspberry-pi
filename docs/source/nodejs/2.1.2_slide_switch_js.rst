2.1.2 Slide Switch
==================

Introduction
------------

In this project, we will learn how to use a slide switch. Usually,the
slide switch is soldered on PCB as a power switch, but here we need to
insert it into the breadboard, thus it may not be tightened. And we use
it on the breadboard to show its function.

Components

Schematic Diagram
-----------------

Connect the middle pin of the Slide Switch to GPIO17, and two LEDs to
pin GPIO22 and GPIO27 respectively. Then when you pull the slide, you
can see the two LEDs light up alternately.

Experimental Procedures
-----------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

.. image:: ../img/image161.png

**Step 2**: Go to the folder of the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/davinci-kit-for-raspberry-pi/nodejs/

**Step 3**: Run the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    sudo node slide_switch.js

While the code is running, get the switch connected to the left, then
the yellow LED lights up; to the right, the red light turns on.

**Code**

.. code-block:: js

    const Gpio = require('pigpio').Gpio; 

    const led1 = new Gpio(22, {mode: Gpio.OUTPUT});
    const led2 = new Gpio(27, {mode: Gpio.OUTPUT});

    const slideSwitch = new Gpio(17, {
        mode: Gpio.INPUT,
        pullUpDown: Gpio.PUD_DOWN,     
        edge: Gpio.EITHER_EDGE        
    });

    slideSwitch.on('interrupt', (level) => {  
        led1.digitalWrite(level);   
        led2.digitalWrite(!level);       
    });


**Code Explanation**

.. code-block:: js

    const Gpio = require('pigpio').Gpio; 

    const led1 = new Gpio(22, {mode: Gpio.OUTPUT});
    const led2 = new Gpio(27, {mode: Gpio.OUTPUT});

    const slideSwitch = new Gpio(17, {
        mode: Gpio.INPUT,
        pullUpDown: Gpio.PUD_DOWN,     
        edge: Gpio.EITHER_EDGE        
    });

Import the pigpio module, and create three objects led1, led2, slideSwitch, 
and control the on and off of led1 and led2 by reading the level of the slideSwitch IO port.   

.. code-block:: js

    slideSwitch.on('interrupt', (level) => {  
        led1.digitalWrite(level);   
        led2.digitalWrite(!level);       
    });

When the read level of the slideSwitch IO port changes,
Write the same level to led1 and the opposite level to led2.
