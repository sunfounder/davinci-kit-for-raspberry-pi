Video 49: Creating A Bouncing Box Overlay in OpenCV
=======================================================================================

In this Raspberry Pi tutorial sponsored by SunFounder, learn how to overlay a bouncing box on a camera feed, emphasizing the importance of planning and thinking like an engineer before coding.


#. **Explanation of the homework assignment**: overlaying a bouncing box on a Raspberry Pi camera feed.
#. **Emphasis on planning before coding**: stressing the importance of thinking like an engineer, sketching out the solution, and labeling key points.
#. **Step-by-step process**: Demonstrating how to translate the sketch into code, defining variables for the box position, size, and movement, and handling edge cases for changing direction when hitting screen boundaries.
#. **Coding demonstration**: Showing the implementation of the solution in Python using OpenCV.
#. **Testing and validation**: Verifying the functionality by running the code and ensuring that the bouncing box behaves as expected on the camera feed.
