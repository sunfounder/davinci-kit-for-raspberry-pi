1.1.7 I2C LCD1602
======================

Introduction
------------------

LCD1602 is a character type liquid crystal display, which can display 32
(16*2) characters at the same time.

Components

* **GND**: Ground
* **VCC**: Voltage supply, 5V.
* **SDA**: Serial data line. Connect to VCC through a pullup resistor.
* **SCL**: Serial clock line. Connect to VCC through a pullup resistor.

As we all know, though LCD and some other displays greatly enrich the man-machine interaction, they share a common weakness. When they are connected to a controller, multiple IOs will be occupied of the controller which has no so many outer ports. Also it restricts other functions of the controller. 

Therefore, LCD1602 with an I2C module is developed to solve the problem. The I2C module has a built-in PCF8574 I2C chip that converts I2C serial data to parallel data for the LCD display.        

* `PCF8574 Datasheet <https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/pcf8574.pdf?ts=1627006546204&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F>`_

**I2C Address**

The default address is basically 0x27, in a few cases it may be 0x3F.

Taking the default address of 0x27 as an example, the device address can be modified by shorting the A0/A1/A2 pads; in the default state, A0/A1/A2 is 1, and if the pad is shorted, A0/A1/A2 is 0.

**Backlight/Contrast**

Backlight can be enabled by jumper cap, unplugg the jumper cap to disable the backlight. The blue potentiometer on the back is used to adjust the contrast (the ratio of brightness between the brightest white and the darkest black).

* **Shorting Cap**: Backlight can be enabled by this capï¼Œunplugg this cap to disable the backlight.
* **Potentiometer**: It is used to adjust the contrast (the clarity of the displayed text), which is increased in the clockwise direction and decreased in the counterclockwise direction.

Experimental Procedures
-----------------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

.. image:: img/image96.png
    :width: 800



**Step 2**: Setup I2C (see :ref:`I2C Configuration`. If you have set I2C, skip this step.)

**Step 3:** Change directory.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/davinci-kit-for-raspberry-pi/c/1.1.7/

**Step 4:** Compile.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    gcc 1.1.7_Lcd1602.c -lwiringPi

**Step 5:** Run.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    sudo ./a.out

After the code runs, you can see \"Greetings\",\"From SunFounder\" displaying on the LCD.

.. note::

    * If there is an error prompt ``wiringPi.h: No such file or directory``, please refer to :ref:`install_wiringpi`.
    * If you get ``Unable to open I2C device: No such file or directory`` error, you need to refer to :ref:`i2c_config` to enable I2C and check if the wiring is correct.
    * If the code and wiring are fine, but the LCD still does not display content, you can turn the potentiometer on the back to increase the contrast.

**Code Explanation**

.. code-block::

    void write_word(int data){â€¦â€¦}
    void send_command(int comm){â€¦â€¦}
    void send_data(int data){â€¦â€¦}
    void init(){â€¦â€¦}
    void clear(){â€¦â€¦}
    void write(int x, int y, char data[]){â€¦â€¦}

These functions are used to control I2C LCD1602 open source code. They allow us to easily use I2C LCD1602.
Among these functions, init() is used for initialization, clear() is used to clear the screen, write() is used to write what is displayed, and other functions support the above functions.

.. code-block:: c

    fd = wiringPiI2CSetup(LCDAddr);

This function initializes the I2C system with the specified device symbol. The prototype of the function:

.. code-block:: c

    int wiringPiI2CSetup(int devId);

Parameters devId is the address of the I2C device, it can be found through the i2cdetect command(see Appendix) and the devId of I2C LCD1602 is generally 0x27.

.. code-block:: c

    void write(int x, int y, char data[]){}

In this function, data[] is the character to be printed on the LCD, and the parameters x and y determine the printing position (line y+1, column x+1 is the starting position of the character to be printed).
