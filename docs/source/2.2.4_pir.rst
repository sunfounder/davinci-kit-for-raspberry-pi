2.2.4 PIR
=========

Introduction
------------

In this project, we will make a device by using the human body infrared
pyroelectric sensors. When someone gets closer to the LED, the LED will
turn on automatically. If not, the light will turn off. This infrared
motion sensor is a kind of sensor that can detect the infrared emitted
by human and animals.

Components
----------

Principle
---------

The PIR sensor detects infrared heat radiation that can be used to
detect the presence of organisms that emit infrared heat radiation.

The PIR sensor is split into two slots that are connected to a
differential amplifier. Whenever a stationary object is in front of the
sensor, the two slots receive the same amount of radiation and the
output is zero. Whenever a moving object is in front of the sensor, one
of the slots receives more radiation than the other , which makes the
output fluctuate high or low. This change in output voltage is a result
of detection of motion.

After the sensing module is wired, there is a one-minute initialization.
During the initialization, module will output for 0~3 times at
intervals. Then the module will be in the standby mode. Please keep the
interference of light source and other sources away from the surface of
the module so as to avoid the misoperation caused by the interfering
signal. Even you'd better use the module without too much wind, because
the wind can also interfere with the sensor.

**Distance Adjustment**


Turning the knob of the distance adjustment potentiometer clockwise, the
range of sensing distance increases, and the maximum sensing distance
range is about 0-7 meters. If turn it anticlockwise, the range of
sensing distance is reduced, and the minimum sensing distance range is
about 0-3 meters.

**Delay adjustment**


Rotate the knob of the delay adjustment potentiometer clockwise, you
can also see the sensing delay increasing. The maximum of the sensing
elay can reach up to 300s. On the contrary, if rotate it
anticlockwise, you can shorten the delay with a minimum of 5s. 

Two trigger modes: (choosing different modes by using the jumper cap).

-  **H:** **Repeatable trigger mode**, after sensing the human body, the
   module outputs high level. During the subsequent delay period, if
   somebody enters the sensing range,the output will keep being the high
   level.

-  **L:** **Non-repeatable trigger mode**, outputs high level when
   it senses the human body. After the delay, the output will change
   from high level into low level automatically.

Experimental Procedures
-----------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

    :width: 800



For C Language Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Step 2:** Go to the folder of the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/davinci-kit-for-raspberry-pi/c/2.2.4/

**Step 3:** Compile the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    gcc 2.2.4_PIR.c -lwiringPi

**Step 4:** Run the executable file.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    sudo ./a.out

After the code runs, PIR detects surroundings and let RGB LED glow
yellow if it senses someone walking by. There are two potentiometers on
the PIR module: one is to adjust sensitivity and the other is to adjust
the detection distance. To make the PIR module work better, you
You need to turn both of them counterclockwise to the end.

    If it does not work after running, or there is an error prompt: \"wiringPi.h: No such file or directory\", please refer to :ref:`C code is not working?`.

    }

**Code Explanation**

.. code-block:: c

    void ledInit(void);
    void ledColorSet(uchar r_val, uchar g_val, uchar b_val);

These codes are used to set the color of the RGB LED, and please refer
to :ref:`1.1.2 RGB LED` for more details.

.. code-block:: c

    int main(void)
    {
        int pir_val;
        //…… 
        pinMode(pirPin, INPUT);
        while(1){
        pir_val = digitalRead(pirPin);

            }
        }
        return 0;

light; if not, emits the blue light.
