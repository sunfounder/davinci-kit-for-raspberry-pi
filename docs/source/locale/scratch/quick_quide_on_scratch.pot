msgid "When programming with Scratch 3, you may need a screen for a better experience. Of course, if you don't have a screen, you can also use **VNC** to access the Raspberry Pi desktop remotely, for a detailed tutorial please refer to :ref:`VNC`."

msgid "In addition, Scratch 3 needs at least 1GB of RAM to run, and we recommend a Raspberry Pi 4 with at least 2GB RAM. While you can run Scratch 3 on a Raspberry Pi 2, 3, 3B+, or a Raspberry 4 with 1GB RAM, performance on these models is reduced, and depending on what other software you run at the same time, Scratch 3 may fail to start due to lack of memory."
