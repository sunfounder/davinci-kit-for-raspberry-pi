msgid "In this project, we will simulate a scenario where the curtains are automatically opened or closed according to the brightness of the room. When the photoresistor detects that the room brightness is too bright, Raspberry Pi will drive the motor to close the curtain; when the room brightness is too dark, the curtain will be opened."

msgid "Also you can view the indoor brightness change through text widget on Cloud4RPi, or control the lamp with Switch widget (for electricity safety, this experiment uses LED instead)."

msgid "Once added, you can use the Switch widget to control the LED; the value of the photoresistor on the Text widget will be updated every 1 minute, when the value > 100, the motor rotates clockwise for 5 seconds; if the value is less than 20, the motor rotates counterclockwise for 5 seconds. You can see the change over time in the Chart widget."
