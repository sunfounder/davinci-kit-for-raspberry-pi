For Linux/Unix Users
==========================

#. Locate and open the **Terminal** on your Linux/Unix system.

#. Ensure your Raspberry Pi is connected to the same network. Verify this by typing `ping <hostname>.local`. For example:

    .. code-block::

        ping raspberrypi.local

    You should see the Raspberry Pi's IP address if it's connected to the network.

    * If the terminal shows a message like ``Ping request could not find host pi.local. Please check the name and try again.``, double-check the hostname you've entered.
    * If you're unable to retrieve the IP address, inspect your network or WiFi settings on the Raspberry Pi.

#. Initiate an SSH connection by typing ``ssh <username>@<hostname>.local`` or ``ssh <username>@<IP address>``. For instance:

    .. code-block::

        ssh pi@raspberrypi.local

#. On your first login, you'll encounter a security message. Type ``yes`` to proceed.

    .. code-block::

        The authenticity of host 'raspberrypi.local (2400:2410:2101:5800:635b:f0b6:2662:8cba)' can't be established.
        ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:oo7x3ZSgAo032wD1tE8eW0fFM/kmewIvRwkBys6XRwg.
        Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?

#. Enter the password you previously set. Note that for security reasons, the password won't be visible as you type.

    .. note::
        It's normal for the password characters not to display in the terminal. Just ensure to enter the correct password.

#. Once you've successfully logged in, your Raspberry Pi is now connected, and you're ready to proceed to the next step.
