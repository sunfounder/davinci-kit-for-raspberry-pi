Video 46: Using the Raspberry Pi Camera in Bullseye with OpenCV
=======================================================================================


This tutorial guides you through setting up and using the Raspberry Pi Camera Module, 
covering essential steps from handling the module to writing Python code for camera interaction. 
Learn how to configure the camera for various purposes, display live video using OpenCV, and implement clean exit mechanisms.

1. Handle the camera module with care to prevent electrostatic damage.
2. Properly connect the camera module to the Raspberry Pi's CSI connector, ensuring correct orientation of the ribbon cable.
3. Exercise caution when lifting the black plastic piece on the CSI connector to avoid damage.
4. Boot up the Raspberry Pi without power connected after attaching the camera module.
5. Understand the transition to the Bullseye 64-bit operating system for compatibility with new features.
6. Set up camera preview configuration.
7. Configure the camera for different purposes (preview, video recording, still images).
8. Start and display the camera preview using OpenCV.
9. Understand images as arrays of pixel values and use OpenCV for image processing.
10. Implement a clean exit mechanism with keyboard input.
11. Explore the potential for advanced image processing between frame grabbing and display.
