Smart Light
=================

In this project, we will learn to control the brightness of LED with Cloud4RPi's Silder widget.

Experimental Procedures
-------------------------

Build the circuit.

.. image:: img/led1.png
  :align: center

Open the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block:: 

    cd ~/cloud4rpi-raspberrypi-python
    sudo nano smart_light.py

Find the line below and fill in the correct device token.

.. code-block:: python

    DEVICE_TOKEN = '__YOUR_DEVICE_TOKEN__'

Run the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block:: 

    sudo python3 smart_light.py

Go to Cloud4RPi, add a new Control Panel named project3, and click **Add Widget** to add a **Slider** widget.

Once added, you can use the Slider widget to control the brightness of the LED.

Code Explanation
----------------------

.. code-block:: python

    led_val = GPIO.PWM(LED_PIN, 2000)
    led_val.start(0)

Call the ``GPIO.PWM()`` function to define ``LED_PIN`` as PWM pin and set the frequency of PWM pin to 2000Hz, then use the ``start()`` function to set the initial duty cycle to 0.

.. code-block:: python

    led_val.ChangeDutyCycle(value)

The value sent by Slider widget to Raspberry Pi is used as PWM duty cycle to change the brightness of the LED.

.. code-block:: python

    variables = {
        'CPU Temp': {
            'type': 'numeric',
            'value': 0,
            'bind': led_control
        },
    }

By setting the value of the ``'value'`` key, we can set the initial value of the Slider widget, then always read the value of the ``'value'`` key and send the current level of ``LED_PIN`` (the value returned by the function ``led_control``) to Cloud4RPi.
