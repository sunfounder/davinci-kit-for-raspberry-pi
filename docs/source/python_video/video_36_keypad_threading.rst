Video 36: Monitoring User Input from Keypad Using Threading
=======================================================================================


This video demonstrates how to create an alarm system using a Raspberry Pi, incorporating keypad input and an LCD display. The video covers various aspects such as wiring instructions, threading for multitasking, command handling, password validation, error handling, and extending functionality. McCarter emphasizes the importance of portability and deployment for real-world applications beyond the desktop.


1. **Portability and Deployment**: Moving Raspberry Pi projects beyond desktop for real-world applications.
2. **Keypad and LCD Setup**: Wiring a keypad and LCD display to Raspberry Pi GPIO pins for input and output.
3. **Threading for Multitasking**: Using threading to handle input from the keypad while executing other tasks.
4. **Keypad Input Integration**: Incorporating keypad input into the project using a library.
5. **Command Handling**: Defining and processing commands for arming, disarming, and changing the password.
6. **Password Validation**: Implementing password validation for system security.
7. **LCD Display Interface**: Interfacing with an LCD display to provide user feedback and prompts.
8. **Error Handling and Debugging**: Techniques for identifying and resolving errors during development.
9. **Extending Functionality**: Suggestions for expanding the project, including integrating additional sensors and audible alarms.
