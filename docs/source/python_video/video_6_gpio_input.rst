Video 6: Understanding GPIO Inputs, Pull Up and Pull Down Resistors
=======================================================================================

Join Paul McWhorter in this comprehensive tutorial as he explains the importance of pull-up and pull-down resistors in microcontroller circuits, demonstrating practical implementations on both Raspberry Pi platforms for GPIO input handling.

1. **GPIO Input Basics**: Learn how to read digital inputs from GPIO pins on microcontroller platforms.
2. **Circuit Setup**: Follow along as Paul demonstrates the physical setup of circuits with push button switches, resistors, and microcontroller boards.
3. **GPIO Pin Configuration**: Understand how to configure GPIO pins for input mode and read input values in Python (for Raspberry Pi) code.
4. **Preventing Floating Inputs**: Discover why it's crucial to avoid floating inputs and how pull-up or pull-down resistors can stabilize input readings.
5. **Pull-Up Resistor**: Ensures a known logic level when the switch is open by connecting the input pin to a high voltage through a resistor.
6. **Pull-Down Resistor**: Ensures a known logic level when the switch is open by connecting the input pin to ground through a resistor.
7. **Functionality**: Demonstrates how the circuit behaves with the switch open and closed, affecting the logic level read by the input pin.
8. **Implementation**: Provides step-by-step instructions on physically setting up the circuit on a breadboard using wires, a push button switch, a resistor, and a microcontroller board.
9. **Homework Assignment**: Encourages viewers to practice controlling an LED with a push button switch and sharing their solutions on YouTube, linking back to the tutorial video.
